#### Introduction

This is a project developed for inspectors to check airline pushback procedures, i.e. location and whether it is in or out of the "Green Zone", an environmental zone defined to protect workers' health and to limit emissions at Schiphol airport. The decoupling location can be used as a proxy for understanding where the decoupling from the pushback tug has occurred, and whether the company is following the guidelines given by the Inspectorate. 

Decoupling moments are identified by unsupervised clustering of location and time data, using the RT-DBSCAN algorithm.  Note that real sample data has been used, but gates and piers have been randomized.
